# Magic Jars
## Game Principle

The player begins with 3 lives.
5 jars are in front of him.
A jar contains either a magic key or a snake.
If the player chooses a jar containing a magic key, he goes to the next round.
Otherwise, he loses a life.

## Parts and Rounds
The game is divided into 4 parts which have 3 rounds.
In the first round there is a snake among the 5 jars.
In the next round, snakes' and keys' disposition changes, except if the player chose a jar containing a snake.
In the next part there is one more snake in one of the 5 jars.
The player wins if he passes all the rounds.
